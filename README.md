This script simplifies the process of managing NGINX sites by providing a command-line interface for common operations such as enabling/disabling, listing, editing, creating, and removing site configurations. This script was designed for Ubuntu. If you want to modify it to make it work for other flavors as well, feel free.

./nginx-sm.sh [options]
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Options

- `-e, --enable`: Enable a site by enabling its configuration file.

```

- `0`: Success - The operation completed successfully.
- `1`: General error - For example, site configuration file not found, or the specified site does not exist in either available or enabled directories.
- `2`: User cancellation - The user aborted the operation (specific to the `remove_site` command).
